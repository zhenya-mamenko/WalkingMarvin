# Walking Marvin
ML project for 42 School Silicon Valley, by @JohnnyJumper and me.

Teach Marvin to walk with OpenAI Gym.

## Instructions
* Extract and install gym from file attached.
* Substitute **gym/envs** folder with one from **envs.zip**.
* If you don't have installed Box2D, install it with ```pip3 install box2d box2d-kengz```. Make sure that you have **swig** already installed.

Run ```python3 marvin.py -h``` for available commands.
Enjoy.
